> "Frontend is dead." — This statement pops up in every tech circle like an urban legend.

Let me be blunt — frontend isn’t dying; it’s evolving. Fast.

We're not in the vanilla JS + jQuery era anymore. Today's frontend devs are solving architectural problems, dealing with performance bottlenecks, optimizing bundle sizes, and making deeply interactive experiences feel native. It’s engineering now — not decoration.

This post is a reflection on where we’ve come from (the old HTML/CSS jungle), where we’re going (component-driven UIs, SSR, islands architecture), and how developers can stay ahead of the curve without falling for the hype trains.

This is not a tutorial — it's a perspective.

Whether you're a React ninja or a Next.js wanderer, I hope this gives you clarity on why frontend is more alive than ever — and more demanding too.

Let me know what you think. I read every message.
