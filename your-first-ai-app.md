> If you can make an API call, you can build something with AI.

I built my first AI-based app over a weekend. No fancy infra. No GPU. Just a good idea, a free OpenAI key, and some creativity.

This post is for every dev who thinks AI is too complex to start with. Spoiler: it’s not.

Here’s how I approached it:
- Picked a small problem to solve (nothing world-changing)
- Designed a flow where AI genuinely added value (not just a gimmick)
- Used simple APIs like GPT-4 or Hugging Face models
- Focused on UX — not just the output

By the end of the weekend, I had a working MVP — and a huge confidence boost.

I walk through the decisions I made, what worked, what flopped, and how **you can build yours** — even if you're not from an AI background.

Let this post be your launchpad. Let’s build smart, not hard.
